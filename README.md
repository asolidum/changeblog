# ChangeBlog

My blog for documenting interesting things and personal projects.

The blog  was previously a [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com/) site running on [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/) servers. I eventually moved to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) hosted on [Github](http://github.com/) servers with images served by [Flickr](http://flickr.com/).

Moving away from Wordpress gave the site a noticable performance boost at no cost. I highly recommend this solution to any developer interested in running a blog.

## Theme Installation

Installation of the hugo theme must be done separately.  Issue the following commands after cloning the repo.

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/MarcusVirg/forty
```
