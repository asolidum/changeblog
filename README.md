# My Blog

This repository is for my blog for documenting things that I find interesting

Back in the day, the blog used to be [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com/) running on [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/) servers. I eventually moved to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) running on [Github](http://github.com/) servers with images served by [Flickr](http://flickr.com/).

By moving away from Wordpress, this site runs noticably faster and is completely free. I would highly recommend this solution for any developer interested in putting up a blog.
