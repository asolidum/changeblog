Having started my programming career in robotics, I enjoy creating software that complements hardware (embedded systems/firmware/etc.).  Lately, I've been developing mobile/web creations like Contact Attack, a web app that took 2nd runner up in the Viadeo Developer Challenge. Our team was also a top six finalist (out of 150 entries) in the Campbell’s API contest, Hack the Kitchen, with a product called Recipe Remixed.

I then joined the team at Happy Hour Pal, an app serving Hawaii, San Diego, Portland, and other markets.  We introduced Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) devices to automate user check-ins for local business discounts.  With the overwhelming interest in our customized check-in analytics, we pivoted Happy Hour Pal and founded AreaMetrics.  Soon we developed a mobile SDK with a corresponding RoR/Golang API backend that eventually integrated into 100+ apps, handled hundreds of millions of daily requests, and grew to an install base of over 50+ million iOS/Android devices.

Some years later, Point Inside acquired our startup, and I helped facilitate the seamless integration of our technology/engineering team into their infrastructure. I would also create the company's first AWS Data Exchange products.

I’m also interested in entrepreneurship and technology growth. I’ve participated in several startup weekends and served on the Honolulu Startup Weekend committee assisting in marketing and developer outreach. I volunteered as a board member for HI Capacity, a Honolulu-based makerspace, and was a key team member that brought Hawaii's first mini-Makerfaire event to Oahu, hosting over 750+ attendees and 30 makers (including participants from neighboring islands). Five years later, it had grown to over 1300+ attendees with 45 amazing makers.

My other interests include surfing, photography, 3D printing, and creative technology in general.
