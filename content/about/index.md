Back in the day, this site used to be [Wordpress][wordpress.link] running on [Dreamhost][dreamhost.link] servers. I then converted it to [Jekyll][jekyll.link] running on [Github Pages][github.link] with images served by [Flickr][flickr.link].

It has upgraded once again to use [Hugo][hugo.link] running on [Gitlab Pages][gitlab.link].

By moving away from Wordpress, this site is noticeably faster, more secure and free to host.  I would highly recommend static site generators (SSG) for any developer interested in putting up a site.
