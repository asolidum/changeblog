Having started my programming career in [robotics][robot.link], I enjoy creating software that complements hardware (embedded systems/firmware/etc.).  Lately, I've been developing mobile/web creations like Contact Attack, a web app that took 2nd runner up in the [Viadeo Developer Challenge][viadeo.link]. Our team was also a top six finalist (out of 150 entries) in the Campbell’s API contest, [Hack the Kitchen][campbells.link], with a product called [Recipe Remixed][submission_video.link].

I then joined the team at [Happy Hour Pal][hhp.link], an app serving Hawaii, San Diego, Portland, and other markets.  We introduced [Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) devices][estimote.link] to automate user check-ins for local business discounts.  With the overwhelming interest in our customized check-in analytics, we pivoted and founded [AreaMetrics][am.link].  Soon we developed a [mobile SDK][sdk.link] with a corresponding RoR/Golang API backend that eventually integrated into 100+ apps, handled hundreds of millions of daily requests, and grew to an install base of over 50+ million iOS/Android devices.

Some years later, [Point Inside][pi.link] acquired our startup, and I helped facilitate the seamless integration of our technology/engineering team into their infrastructure. I would also create the company's first [AWS Data Exchange][aws_exchange.link] products.

#### Volunteering

I’m also interested in entrepreneurship and technology growth. I’ve participated in several startup weekends and served on the [Honolulu Startup Weekend][swl.link] committee assisting in marketing and developer outreach. I volunteered as a board member for [HI Capacity][hicap.link], a Honolulu-based makerspace, and was a key team member that brought Hawaii's first [mini-Makerfaire][makerfaire.link] event to Oahu, hosting over 750+ attendees and 30 makers (including participants from neighboring islands). Five years later, it had grown to over 1300+ attendees with 45 amazing makers.

My other interests include surfing, photography, 3D printing, and creative technology in general.
