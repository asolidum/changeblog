My girlfriend's parents have a tradition of getting a new ornament wherever they travel. I really liked that concept because each ornament ends up being an amazing travel story or memory.

Since we haven't had as many travel opportunities as her parents, our tree is currently pretty ornament challenged. If you know me, I'm a builder and want to fill our barren tree with some DIYed ornaments.

Today, I visited one of my favorite 3D printing websites, [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/).  After a bit of browsing, I found a [Snowflake Ornament Generator](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:188481).

Using Thingiverse's built in customizer, you can generate unique ornaments using a random seed value.  Here are the ones we created.

[Thingiverse's customizer](https://www.thingiverse.com/customizer) is essentially a web UI for SCAD files.  Apparently, [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) is an open-source 3D CAD software modeler geared towards programmers. Hmmm... 3D printing and programming. Sounds like I'm gonna have to learn how to write SCAD files sometime soon.

BTW, here are some other ornaments that I thought might be fun to print like [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:563396) or [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2739855)
