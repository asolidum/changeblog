My girlfriend's parents have a tradition of getting a new ornament wherever they travel. I liked that concept because each ornament becomes a special reminder of that vacation.

Since we haven't had as many travel opportunities as her parents, our tree is currently pretty ornament challenged. If you know me, I'm a builder and am always thinking of how we can fill the barren tree with some DIYed ornaments.

Today, I visited one of my favorite 3D printing websites, [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/).  After a bit of browsing, I found a [Snowflake Ornament Generator](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:188481).

Using Thingiverse's built-in customizer, you can generate unique ornaments with a random seed value.  Here are the ones we created.

[Thingiverse's customizer](https://www.thingiverse.com/customizer) is essentially a web UI for SCAD files.  Apparently, [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) is an open-source 3D CAD modeling application that utilizes a scripting language. Hmmm... 3D printing and programming. It looks like I'm gonna have to learn SCAD sometime soon.

BTW, here are some other ornaments that I thought might be fun to print like [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:563396) or [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2739855).
